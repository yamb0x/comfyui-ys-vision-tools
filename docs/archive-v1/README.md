# Archive: Original YS-Vision v2 Documentation

This directory contains the original documentation for YS-Vision v2, before the major enhancements that transformed it into **YS-vision-tools**.

## Archived Files

1. **00-PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md** - Original project overview with basic features
2. **02-PHASE1-MVP.md** - Original Phase 1 with basic tracking and simple curves
3. **06-PROJECT-SUMMARY.md** - Original project summary and roadmap
4. **README.md** - Original index file

## Why These Were Archived

The project underwent significant enhancements:

### Original Scope (Archived)
- Basic corner/blob detection
- Simple straight/bezier curves
- CPU-focused with optional GPU in Phase 3
- Target: 1080p @ 10fps

### Enhanced Scope (Current)
- 7+ smart detection methods (gradient, phase, optical flow, YOLO)
- 15+ mathematical curves (spirals, field lines, Fourier, neural flow)
- GPU-first design for RTX 5090
- Target: 4K @ 60fps, 8K @ 30fps

## When to Reference These

These archived files may be useful if you need to:
- Understand the original simpler implementation approach
- Build a CPU-only version
- See the progression from basic to advanced features
- Reference the original specifications

## Current Documentation

For the current enhanced version, see the main `/docs/plans/` directory:
- **00-PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md** - Enhanced version
- **02-PHASE1-MVP.md** - Enhanced version with GPU acceleration
- **ENHANCEMENT-SUMMARY.md** - Details all improvements
